They are also located in critical geographies for global supply chains along the South China Sea and East China Sea. The world’s great powers are dependent on these countries for their own technological competitiveness.  \\nThe importance of these countries in multilateral cooperation has been clear for some time. In addition to their roles in the enforcement of export controls, in March 2022, US President Joe Biden reportedly proposed a “CHIP 4” grouping of the US and these three East Asian governments, a move seen as not only aimed at isolating Beijing, but also at creating greater supply-chain diversification and protecting companies’ intellectual property. However, the initiative has not yet made significant progress.  \\nAs artificial intelligence becomes a greater part of daily life, these countries’ geopolitical importance will continue to grow. Taiwan’s dominance of high-end semiconductor manufacturing is of particular consequence. The island nation manufactures 68% of semiconductors globally and 90% of leading-edge semiconductors necessary for advanced AI applications. No other country, and no other company, can produce high-end semiconductors in the quantity and quality of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The great powers rely on Taiwanese-made chips that power everything from smartphones to advanced weapons systems. Because of that reality, many leaders, including Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, have referred to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as its “silicon shield,” protecting it from aggression and supply-chain disruptions. However, a recent Council on Foreign Relations report argued that TSMC’s position may make potential aggression by Beijing more likely, as Beijing could have an interest in gaining control of the company and using it for geopolitical leverage.  \\nThe final country that is critical for global semiconductor supply chains is the Netherlands. The Dutch company ASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are necessary for the ever-more sophisticated integrated circuits in semiconductor fabrication, at a cost of $330 million or more for each machine. According to Goldman Sachs Research, EUV could increase the size of the global semiconductor market from $600 billion in 2022 to $1 trillion by the end of the decade.', metadata={'id': '33486450-e039-42a5-8799-b39cd8ad02d2', 'Header 2': 'Japan, The Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan'}), 0.6755666676675587)\n",
